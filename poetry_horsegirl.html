    <p>
      When it got warm enough outside to stand it<br>
      my parents decided to have a yard sale,<br>
      a chance to fill the driveway with silk blouses and old books,<br>
      the pierced leather chair from the office, the hair scarf that wasn't my Mother's.<br><br>
      Being seven, almost an adult, I wanted to participate.<br>
      I took stock of my possessions -<br>
      three bare-breasted Barbies who wore only pepto bismol high heels<br>
      on their permanent tip toes,<br>
      a plastic pearl necklace,<br>
      the ring from the coin machine at Walmart that stained my finger emerald,<br>
      and the thirteen Snapple caps that still smelled like lemon and peaches,<br>
      still tasted sweet when you licked their insides.<br><br>
      I could part with one Barbie, the necklace and 12 of the bottle caps -<br>
      I'd keep the one that promised Chincoteague ponies had been swimming the channel since 1925,<br>
      to then be auctioned off to anyone with the money.<br>
      If I made the case to my parents they would have to let me save just one pony -<br>
      without me, I cried, they'll be turned into pet food -<br>
      (an unfortunate fact I had learned from a heartless neighbor boy)<br>
      I would point at our dog accusingly, and he would bow his head appropriately.<br>
      The sacrifices I made for the yard sale would be a good start<br>
      towards pony-rescuing-money.<br><br>
      That Sunday, I laid a butter yellow kitchen towel over our beach cooler<br>
      and spread my treasures across it.<br>
      The Snapple caps glinted in the afternoon sun, the naked Barbie smiling, smooth and perfect -<br>
      I tried to find her dress the night before but hadn't been able to,<br>
      the girl who bought her would have to promise that she had a box full of tiny coats and matching<br>
      purses, that she would find her the perfect outfit as soon as she ran home.<br><br>
      The neighbors walked past me and waved,<br>
      they laughed and nudged their husbands in the ribs with practiced elbows for a quarter or two<br>
      which they presented to me with an open palm before moving along empty-handed.<br>
      I looked at the painstakingly crafted sign advertising my pony-rescuing-plans -<br>
      don't they understand, I thought,<br>
      I'm trying to save a life.<br><br>
      After hours in the heat had baked my damp hair into its braids a man moved towards me,<br>
      tall enough to block the sun, too old to be childless in our neighborhood.<br>
      He smiled down at me, his teeth square and overcrowded, his lips wet.<br><br>
      <i>What's this?</i><br><br>
      He grabbed my Barbie,<br>
      ran his knife-thin fingers over her Hershey kiss knees,<br>
      through her yellow hair.<br><br>
      I hated him in a second with more anger than I had ever felt in my body before.<br>
      The feeling scared me with how quickly it took over,<br>
      a damp heat in my stomach that wouldn't leave.<br><br>
      He pulled a five dollar bill from his jeans pocket, wrapping it around the doll's leg like a fist<br>
      before tossing her back on the cooler,<br>
      face down.<br><br>
    <i>That's for you, because you're so cute.</i><br><br>
      As soon as he left, I threw everything into the skirt of my dress, picked up the edges and ran<br>
      inside, my bare feet pounding up the stairs to my room.<br><br>
      I put the necklace on my dresser,<br>
      the Snapple caps in my pencil case,<br>
      The ring on my finger,<br>
      and the Barbie back with her friends in the chest at the foot of my bed.<br>
      As I slammed the lid shut an apology spilled uncontrolled from my mouth,<br>
      like a cough full of salt water.<br><br>
      I would use the $5.75 I had made to buy her a new dress,<br>
      something soft and pink that swept her ankles.<br><br>
      The pony would just have to die.<br>
