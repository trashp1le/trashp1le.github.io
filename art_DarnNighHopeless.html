    <p><b>About the Artist</b>: <i>Seth D. Ellison is a Philadelphia-based painter and multimedia artist. He was born
in Beckley, West Virginia in 1984, and lived mainly in the southern United States
before moving to attend grad school. His formative years were spent
compulsively drawing in preparation for a future career as a Walt Disney
animator, a period in his life that deeply impacted the paintings he does today.
Seth received his BFA from the Savannah College of Art and Design in 2009 and
then an MFA from the University of the Arts in 2012, both with a concentration in
painting and studio art. He has also studied graphic design at Concord University
and was accepted into the SCAD Lacoste program. He has exhibited his work in
Manhattan, Brooklyn, New Jersey, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, among many
other places.</i>

    <p><b>Artist Statement</b>: My work reflects my own personal experiences in relation to my upbringing in the
rural South. It is a place that has been relegated to the margins of American
history and culture, a position that left me with a sharp awareness of my own
identity and its connection to it. I revive and express the region’s struggles and
contradictions, interweaving my own personal narrative within its sociological
mythology. What emerges is darkly comedic and allegorical, composed of
isolating landscapes that are inhabited by tragic and exploited figures uncovered
from the recesses of the American psyche.
My appropriative painting process leads me to draw from past art traditions, such
as the 17th and 18th century European masters who gentrified agrarian
landscapes. I then amalgamate these sources with mid-20th century American
publications and memorabilia featuring derogatory depictions of Appalachians
and Southerners. This hybridization of influences proposes an examination of
American stereotypes, its limitations, and fears, permeated by an underlying
yearning for transcendence. Instead of suppressing the inevitable outcome using
these sources — the bucolic, nostalgic, and sentimental — I embrace and
recontextualize them through my own contemporary vantage point, raking over
the embers to see what still needs to be said.</p>
