    <p style="text-align: center"><b><u>PROLOGUE - PRESENT DAY</u></b></p>
    <br>
    <p>EXT - YOUNG HOUSE - MID MORNING</p>
    <p>A very nice house. Not gaudy, just classy. A well kept yard, a patio for hosting parties. The back door is off the ground, up a set of stairs.
</p>
<br>
<p>TALKING HEAD - GREY</p>
<p>Documentary style close on the teenager, standing outside against the house. Much more informal than the character interviews later in the episode.<br><br>
This is <b>GRAVITY “GREY” YOUNG</b> - 15, non-binary, sparkly sunshiny agreeable doormat. Deeply lonely, a quiet observer and bashful straight-A student. They look somewhere between nervous and excited and seem at a loss for what to say.<br>
A lower third title simply reads “GREY YOUNG”<br><br>
They speak directly to <b>THE CAMERA</b> - We/They/Us, neutral, an objective audience member until they’re not.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">GREY<br>
Big day, emotions are running high.<br>
&emsp;(beat)<br>
I wonder if this is what prom feels like?<br>
</p>
<p>INT. HOUSE - MID MORNING - HALLWAY </p>
<p>A middle upper class house. An original Alexander Calder painting hangs on the wall.<br><br>
Grey creeps down the hallway, on a mission. They stop in from of a woven painting and point it out.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">GREY<br>
&emsp;(sotto)<br>
Our moms.<br>
</p>
<p>They continue down the hallway and stop in front of the bathroom door. They make a shushing gesture and then point into the door.
The camera swings and pokes it’s lens into the room.<br><br>
</p>
<p>INT - BATHROOM - DAY </p>
<p>A big mirror. Nice decor for a bathroom.</p>
<p><b>MINNESOTA “MINI” YOUNG</b> - 17, punk; a fierce, defensive layer and her deadpan humor hide a deep sense of hope and sorrow.<br><br>
She focuses on her reflection in the mirror. She is dressed in all black, an alternative approach to formal-wear, and she is putting the finishing touches on her heavy eyeliner.<br><br>
Her hand shakes as she draws the line and she is overcome with a sudden moment of panic. She throws down the liner, fending off an anxiety attack.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">MINI<br>
(under her breath)<br>
Shiiiiit...<br>
</p>
<p>She runs the cold tap and splashes water on her face to calm down. She looks back up into the mirror and realizes her mistake; her dark makeup has begun to smear down her face. She looks bad, it looks bad.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">MINI (CONT'D)<br>
  God damn it, Minnesota. Get it together.<br>
</p>
<p>Mini tries in vain to fix it, dabbing under her eyes with some balled up toilet paper.<br><br>
As she does this she catches a glimpse of the camera in the reflection and gives the lens a scorching look; their presence has become an intrusion.<br><br>
A soft knock on the door.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">GREY<br>
&emsp;(O.S.)<br>
Mini?<br></p>
<p>The door opens to Grey. They look back and forth between Mini and the camera, assessing the situation.<br><br>
Grey enters the bathroom cautiously. They treat Mini with a good amount of caution.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">GREY (CONT'D)<br>
  Ruby's here.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">MINI<br>
I'll be down in a minute. <br>
</p>
<p>Grey sees Mini in the mirror.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">GREY<br>
Oh,<br>
</p>
<p>Grey hugs Mini who doesn't quite understand the contact and remains staring herself down in the mirror, unreceptive.<br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">GREY (CONT'D)<br>
  It wasn’t your fault. You did<br>
everything you could.<br>
</p>
<p>Mini can’t hold her own eye contact in the mirror. She shrugs off Grey’s affection. Grey hangs on for a moment longer, squeezing their sibling tightly until Mini squirms with discomfort from the intimacy. Grey lets her go.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">MINI<br>
Yeah. Ok. I’ll be down in a minute.<br>
</p>
<p>EXT. THE YOUNG HOUSE - MID MORNING</p>
<p>Grey waits alone. They check their watch and glance up at the door. The door opens and Grey brightens.<br><br>
<b>GRANDMA LEAR</b> (70s, very cool) exits and beckons Grey over. Grey crosses up the stairs to Grandma Lear, who says something softly to them while glancing at the camera.<br><br>
Grey turns to the camera.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">GREY<br>
(yelling to the camera)<br>
Can we get you anything? Water? A<br>
scone? We might have some leftover <br>
coffee in the Mr. Coffee pot.<br>
<br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">CAMERA (O.S.)<br>
  (calling back)<br>
  No thanks, Grandma Lear.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">GREY<br>
  Ok! No worries!<br>
(}back to grandma)<br>
  Thanks, grams.<br>
</p>
<p>Grandma Lear gives the camera a thumbs up, ruffles Grey’s hair, and then disappears back inside.<br><br>
Grey comes back down the stairs, crossing to the camera.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">GREY (CONT'D)<br>
  (nervously)<br>
  You’re not going to tell Mini about the…<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">CAMERA (O.S.)<br>
  No, not ours to tell.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">GREY<br>
  Ok.<br>
  (beat)<br>
  Ok, great. Thanks.</p>
  <p>Mini exits the house, Grey rushes back to the bottom of the stairs to meet her. The camera stays where it is. <br><br>
They approach a waiting parked car of which the passenger side door is open and a girl is perched sideways in the seat.<br><br>
<b>RUBY RAIN</b> - 17, a teenager PR agent, intense and driven, and too brilliant for her own good. Her followers would call her a Girlboss, her enemies would call her a control-freak, but she would describe herself as “perfection and optimization oriented”.<br><br>
However, we’ve caught her on a rare bad day. She is disheveled and unfocused - makeup-less and in athleisure. She drinks a large iced coffee out of a reusable tumbler and wipes her eyes as she stares off into the distance. <br><br>
She sees Mini approach and, noticing her smeared makeup, gets up and hugs her. When they pull apart, they remain forehead to forehead.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">RUBY<br>
  (like the intimate version of <br> a motivational speaker)<br>
You are such a good leader. I’m <br>proud of who you are.<br>
</p>
<p>They pull apart. Ruby licks her finger and tries to wipe away a smear of Mini’s eye makeup. Mini bats away her hand. <br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">MINI<br>
  Staaaap.<br>
</p>
<p>Ruby offers her some coffee, Mini declines. They all get in the car and drive away.<br></p>
<p>EXT. CARKEEK PARK - EARLY AFTERNOON</p>
<p>Carkeek Park is a classic Seattle park: it is wilderness within boundaries. There is a beach, there is a forest, there are train tracks. We are overlooking a rather large field.<br><br>
A small but fierce crowd of kids has gathered in what is the best version of a memorial teenagers can make.<br><br>
They’re all dressed in black and singing a melancholic rendition of “The ABC Song” with good intentions. They stand around a pile of garbage and other refuse that they treat with reverence.<br><br>
Mini, Grey, and Ruby are the last to join. Ruby adds a piece of cardboard with seemingly indiscriminate nail polish markings on it to the collection.<br><br>
She takes Mini’s hand, and leads her and Grey into the circle which parts to allow them space and the singing comes to a close.<br><br>
They all look at Mini expectantly. She scans faces, searching.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">RUBY<br>
  (gently)<br>
  I don’t think he’s -- <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">MINI<br>
  (more sharply than intended)<br>
  It’s fine. I didn’t expect<br>
  anything. Not from him. <br>
</p>
<p>Mini takes a deep breath, steeling herself against the crowd’s gaze. She opens her mouth to speak, but can’t bring herself to do it. She looks like she might pass out.<br><br>
Ruby takes her hand.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">RUBY<br>
  Do you want me to…?<br>
</p>
<p>Mini breathes.<br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">MINI<br>
  No...<br>
  (a moment)<br>
  Thank you all for coming. I...<br>
</p>
<p>
  She looks up and words fail her.<br><br>
  ATLANTIS “ATLAS” DAGNY - 17, hurt and anger bubbling under his skin, and so clearly ripping off JD from Heathers.<br><br>
  He stops short of the circle. Him and Mini hold eye contact. Nobody moves.<br><br>
  We pull above them (DRONE SHOT) and see the circle of teenagers. The pile of garbage is revealed to be large tarp that is made of various ‘Z’ shaped pieces of fabric sewn together.<br><br>
  They have covered it with another ‘Z’ shape, this one made up of sticks, flowers, stones, shells, and also random park trash like chip bags and soda cans.<br><br>
Among the trash are polaroids of various people with red ‘X’s on their forehead, a poorly done Bob Ross-esque painting of the sea covered in coffee, cardboard pieces with ‘?’ on them, and various other confusing art pieces.<br><br>
[AN: the pieces are obscured enough that we don’t quite understand what they are, but recognizable enough to spark our memory later.] <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">FADE TO:<br></p>
  <p>WHITE SCREEN and FADE IN a black title: <br></p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><b>THREE WEEKS EARLIER. </b><br></p>
  <p>FADE FROM BLACK ON WHITE TO WHITE ON BLACK AND THEN FADE TO... <br></p>
  <p><u>B-ROLL ON BLACK SCREEN</u></p>
  <p>A yearbook photo of a teenage boy flashes on the screen, bordered by the superlative “Most likely to maybe become famous at some point”.<br><br>
B-roll: We now see a series of shots of the boy:<br><br>
<b>JAMESON “JAY” JAMESON JR.</b> - 17, fuckboy pretentious “artiste”. Very pretty, deceptively stupid, unexplainably charming.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">NARRATOR (O.S.)<br>
  Due to his contribution to the<br>
local art scene, Jay Jameson has <br>
skyrocketed to levels of fame never <br>
seen before at Mariners High. His <br>
freeform multi-medium style strikes <br>
a chord with students from all <br>
walks of life and ushered in a new <br>
era called ‘Jamesontown’. <br>
Affectionately. <br>
</p>
<p>Black and white “dramatic reenactment” footage plays over narration: <br><br>
Jay pushing through crowds of teens clamoring for his autograph. Paparazzi camera flashes. <b>TYLER</b> (18, jock, see below) acts as his bodyguard. <br><br>
Next, he stands on an auditorium stage - the house is packed and the lights are bright. He walks at the front of the stage, doing a silent call and response. <br><br>
There is an easel center stage, on which something sits covered by a cloth. Jay dramatically pulls off the cloth to reveal the art piece to thunderous standing ovation from the packed audience. <br><br>
He dives to crowd surf. Freeze frame!<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">NARRATOR (O.S.) (CONT’D)<br>
  His latest and only series "Alpha,<br>
Beta, Omnibus" takes a dive into <br>
how we break down the expanse of <br>
modern language into minuscule <br>
parts and was inspired by the <br>
alphabet sponges he has - I mean, <br>
had in the bath. His best pieces <br>
include ‘B’, ‘J’, and ‘X’. <br>
</p>
<p>Photo cycle over narration: <br><br>
Him running away from a badly photoshopped swarm of bees forming the shape of a ‘B’; a painting of a ‘B’ made up of bees.<br><br>
A tiktok of him making multiple ‘J’ shapes with his body either airborne or on the ground.<br><br>
The ‘X’ polaroid photo cycle: <br><br>
A photo of a young Jay with his kindergarten girlfriend with a red ‘X’ on her forehead. “Jay and EX; Emily - [ Unknown, Pacific Crest Elementary School ]” <br><br>
A polaroid of EX 1, BRITTA (16, girl nextdoor, down to earth vibe) with an ‘X’ drawn on her forehead in lipstick, crying. “Jay and EX; Britta - [ January, Seattle ]” <br><br>
A portrait of Atlas with a red lipstick ‘X’ drawn on his forehead. Atlas stares dead into the camera, it’s a little worrying. “Jay and EX; Atlas - [ May, Seattle ]” <br><br>
A selfie of him with Ruby with a red lipstick ‘X’ drawn on his own forehead. “Jay and EX; Ruby - [ August, Seattle ]” <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">NARRATOR (O.S.) (CONT’D)<br>
  His piece, ‘X’, was completed at <br>
the end of last school year to <br>
intense emotional reception. Over <br>
the summer, Jay took a break to <br>
recover his sense of self and <br>
creativity. <br>
</p>
<p>Jay stares at a white wall, he strokes it gently, hits it with the side of his fist, turns around leans against it, sliding to the floor, where he finds a white jacket. He puts it on and looks up into the camera, ready to be seen again.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">FADE TO: </p>
<p>TALKING HEAD - JAY - DAHL FIELD </p>
<p>he narrator is revealed to be Jay who we see in a talking head, standing in a park. A lower third title - “Jay Jameson: (he/him) visual and performance artist”. <br><br>
He wears all white: white jeans, white socks, white Birkenstock clogs, a white t-shirt, and a white jacket. He has a gold necklace with a ‘J’ on it, but the cross of the J is slightly lower than the top so it looks like a cross necklace thats bent at the end. <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">JAY<br>
  However with the help of his <br>
manager, life coach, and ex <br>
girlfriend Ruby Rain, he is ready <br>
to reenter with his latest, and <br>
penultimate installment - one that <br>
is not only a statement piece, but <br>
also a question...'Y?'. <br>
</p>
<p>EXT. DAHL FIELD - DAY</p>
<p>Dahl Field is a park adjacent to the high school, Mariners High, but it doesn’t belong to Mariners High. It has a baseball field and bleachers, a recently updated playground paired with a long disused kiddie pool, and woods on one side. Mariners High is the wealthiest public high school in the city.<br><br>
Jay stands next to a cardboard cutout of the letter 'Y', hung upside down, as he paints question marks onto it with nail polish OR smelly markers he smells before using.<br><br>
There is a red velvet rope in front of the ‘Y’. Inside the rope, the three VIP Preps sit. They sip on cortados and generally fawn over Jay.<br><br>
<b>ALIZA</b> (16, theatre kid, wearing white) is inside the rope and Jay takes a selfie with her. She starts crying, Jay wipes the tear with his thumb and presses it onto his heart. Tyler unceremoniously ushers her away. <br><br>
Outside the rope, there are groups of kids mingling, all of them wearing white to the best of their ability.<br><br>
They belong to one of three factions - the STEM socialites, the jocks, and the drama kids. Each group ruled by a VIP Prep. <br><br>
<b>KENNEDY COPPOLA</b> - 17, she/her. STEM student, socialite, sociopath. She’s in tennis whites and a high ponytail, with a white scrunchy. Preppy and privileged - both used to her advantage. <br><br>
<b>TYLER COPPOLA</b> - 18, he/him. Lax, football, soccer, basketball, polo - all within his wheelhouse, a true jock - all white letterman’s (special ordered) jacket included. Acting Jay’s bodyguard. He will likely go to business school. <br><br>
<b>SUMMER BEAUZO</b> - 17, she/her, president of the drama club. She wears all white in an expensive crunchy granola Cochella 2016 way complete with a white flower crown. She really wants to be someone’s muse. <br><br>
They *are* the upper class. <br><br>
Ruby - looking impeccable in head to toe Aritzia - white slacks, white sneakers, a white t-shirt under a white blazer but she has a bold color statement accessory (her form of rebellion). She compensates well for her lack of wealth, you’d never know she’s less rich than everyone else. <br><br>
She stands a few feet away, with one AirPod in (one AirPod is always in), texting rapidly & occasionally looking up. <br><br>
The camera pans and zooms in on Atlas dressed in black. He sits about 30 feet away on the ground, ripping out the grass angrily and glaring. The camera zooms back to the group, keeping Atlas in frame, far away. <br>
</p>
<p>TALKING HEAD - RUBY - PARK </p>
<p>Ruby speaks in a quick monotone, barely looking up from her phone. <br><br>
Lower third title reads: “Ruby Rain (she/her): manager, PR, entrepreneur, self-select AP student (5 classes)”. <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">RUBY<br>
  I’m Ruby Rain. I don’t like to use <br>
the word “manager”, I’m a fixer - I <br>
fix problems. My partnership with <br>
Jay grew over this past summer. I <br>
saw him through and out of a dark <br>
time in his life. As a result, <br>
we’re collaborating on our senior <br>
projects; his series, and my documentary <br>
The ‘Z’ installment will premiere <br>
at my gallery, “Rainstorm Gallery,” <br>
along with the entire “Alpha, Beta, <br>
Omnibus” series, A to Z. God willing. <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">CUT TO: </p>
<p>EXT - PARK - DAY </p>
<p>Long stalker shot of Atlas and Ruby. Fighting. <br></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">CUT IN: </p>
<p style="text-align: center;">RUBY<br>
  Atlas, just give it back, you’re <br>
being irrational. Everyone sees <br>
your value, a piece of art is <br>
nothing without it’s muse. <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">ATLAS<br>
  Muse? Please. We both know that’s <br>
not the credit I deserve. Maybe <br>
that’s what you’re happy being, but <br>
I’ll be keeping the ‘A’ piece close <br>
to my chest until I can be sure <br>
I’ll be paid what I’m due.<br>
</p>
<p>Atlas begins to walk away.<br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">RUBY<br>
  (yelling after him) <br>
BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN???? <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">ATLAS<br>
  (over his shoulder, with finger quotes)<br>
Talk to your “artist”!<br>
</p>
<p>Ruby screams.<br></p>
<p>TALKING HEAD - RUBY</p>
<p>Trying really hard to be calm about it. Failing.
<br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">RUBY<br>
  Jay gifted the ‘First Letter’ piece <br>
to his original <br>
(finger quotes) <br>
“collaborator” who won’t give it <br>
back!! We need the whole series.<br>
Who cares about an alphabet that <br>
starts with ‘B’?! <br>
(beat) <br>
Artist’s muses are so emotional.<br>
</p>
<p>TALKING HEAD - ATLAS </p>
<p>Talking head - Lower third reads: “Atlantis “Atlas” Dagny: (he/him) Current senior, former muse.”
<br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">ATLAS<br>
  It’s my civic duty to keep an eye <br>
on Jay. Unlike Ruby, I don’t want <br>
anyone else marred by his <br>
emotionally destructive ways. <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">CAMERA (O.C.)<br>
  What happened between you and Jay? <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">ATLAS<br>
  He uses people for his art. Like, <br>
emotionally. He took it too far — <br>
</p>
<p>Ruby rushes over.<br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">RUBY<br>
  NO! Don’t talk to him! He gets NO <br>
  screen time until the terms are settled!!!<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">CUT TO: </p>
<p>TALKING HEAD - RUBY</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">RUBY<br>
  I would say Jay is… a very <br>
expressive person. His art thrives <br>
when he <br>
(finger quotes) <br>
“feels things”. He’s a free spirit <br>
and people’s reactions to that are <br>
their responsibility, not my <br>
artist’s, and not mine. My job is <br>
to keep him focused.<br>
</p>
<p>She perks her ears like a cat, hearing something Jay said, and turns to do damage control. The camera tries to follow her but lags and their words are muffled and we see them in subtitles. Swear words are beeped out. <br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">RUBY (CONT’D)<br>
  Jay! God damnit - stop asking our <br>
fucking friends to punch you in the nose <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">JAY<br>
  You don’t understand, I need the <br>
  blood for my art! <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">RUBY<br>
  That's fucked up! <br>
(back to camera, a shriek) <br>
Stop filming!!! <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">JUMP CUT <br></p>
<p>THE SAME SCENE - several dramatic moments later. Jay stands facing the group gazing down at Ruby’s phone, making his best attempt to read. Someone is filming this for instagram live.
<br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">JAY<br>
  (a la press conference) <br>
Thank you all for being here. It <br>
has come to my attention that my <br>
inflammatory behavior on the school <br>
tennis court, next to the parking <br>
lot, where Stanley found that penny <br>
from 1983, was unacceptable, and <br>
that my actions, on the tennis <br>
court, next to the parking lot, <br>
where Kennedy discovered that the <br>
penny was actually from 1993, have <br>
resulted in physical harm brought <br>
upon myself, by myself, and… <br>
</p>
<p>He looks at Ruby.<br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">RUBY<br>
  (instructing) <br>
Alienation <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">JAY<br>
Alienation and...<br>
</p>
<p>Another look to Ruby. <br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">RUBY<br>
Psychological torment? <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">JAY<br>
  Oh duh, psychological torment of my peers. <br>
  I should not have told Stanley his <br>
penny wasn’t bright, just like him, <br>
so he would start a fight. There <br>
are better reasons to start a <br>
fight, I know that now. And it was <br>
inappropriate of me to bring it up <br>
again and ask Tyler to recreate the <br>
moment of impact with me, here, <br>
today, now, just moments ago. <br>
That’s my bad, bro. <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">TYLER<br>
  (in solidarity)<br>
  Bro.<br>
</p>
<p>
Summer raises her hand.
<br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">RUBY<br>

<p style="text-align: center;">KENNEDY<br>
Do we get to see the blood today?<br>

<p style="text-align: center;">JAY<br>
  No, that piece is in my parent’s home.<br>

  Art’s really evocative. So I’m <br>

<p style="text-align: center;">TYLER<br>
  Jay is what we in the business call <br>
an “investment”. I've been <br>
following his work since the <br>
haunting installment, "G". It’s <br>
important to get in early so you <br>
can say you “knew them when”. That <br>
goes far at parties.<br>

<p>Summer’s talking head. Lower third reads: Summer Beauzo
(she/her): Poetry reader, painting looker, band audience

<p style="text-align: center;">SUMMER<br>
  Not everyone understands that Jay <br>
is like, an actual genius. He,<br>

condition and, like, expresses it.<br>

<p style="text-align: center;">KENNEDY<br>
  Dr. Shapiro says that engaging with <br>
art is my exposure therapy. Because <br>
art... evokes... feelings.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">SUMMER<br>
  want to be the inspiration for an<br>
art piece. I dated a musician<br>
because I wanted a song written<br>
about me. It never happened. I<br>
shouldn’t have picked the drummer.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">TYLER<br>
  It was a ghost, the ‘G’ piece. I<br>
had a lizard who died once, I think<br>
that’s why I really connected to<br>
it. Like it was personally made for me.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">KENNEDY<br>
  So far I was excited about the<br>
blood. And then disappointed.<br>
That’s called progress.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">SUMMER<br>
  One time I was on the subway in New<br>
York and right before I got off, a<br>
man ran up to me and gave me a<br>
drawing he had done of me, and then<br>
he ran away. If I can inspire art<br>
there, I can definitely do it in<br>
Seattle.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">TYLER<br>
I keep telling Jay that his art<br>
would do really well as NFTs, but<br>
he says he’s not interested in<br>
football.<br> </p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">KENNEDY<br>
    You know, Jay actually invited me<br>
here himself, with his own fingers<br>
on Instagram.<br>
</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">SUMMER<br>
      - he messaged me personally, on Instagram -<br></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">TYLER<br>
      - Jay slid into my DMs so I know it<br>
means a lot to him that I'm here.<br>
</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">KENNEDY<br>
        I'm his plus one.<br>

  Grey hold up a stack of DIY zines like a tray which Mini is
  staple gunning to trees and/or play structures. Mini has a

<p>Ruby approaches Grey and Mini. Grey turns, ready to engage.
Mini rolls her eyes and continues to staples her zines,
covering “If you cross this sign you are consenting to your
image and voice being used for photo/video purposes” signs.<br></p>

Invitation only!<br>

<p>Ruby is furious. She rips the zine off the tree, revealing
the sign again. She points.<br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">RUBY<br>
  (cuts her off)<br>
  OKAY, well if you cross the sign <br>
  you are consenting to your image <br>

<p>She pulls out a stack of printed NDA's from a tote bag and
hands one to each of them.<br></p>

<p>Grey pulls out a pen immediately and tries to sign.<br></p>

What the fuck is this? <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">RUBY<br>
  An NDA and please don’t swear, it <br>
  makes our editor’s job much harder. <br>

<p>Mini rips the NDA out of Grey’s hand and makes a big show of folding them in half. She puts them in her tote bag. <br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">MINI<br>
  I'll have to look this over. Our dad’s a lawyer.<br>

<p>Grey sneaks the NDA from Mini’s bag of zines and looks around for a place to sign. Summer offers her back. <br></p>

Welcome to the documentation of Jay<br>
Jameson's first ever art cycle -<br>
specifically the 'Y' installment of<br>
his Alpha series.<br>
</p>
<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
<p style="text-align: center; padding-right: 25px;">GREY<br>
  Who?<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">MINI<br>
  Why?<br>
</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">RUBY<br>
There are rumors of buyers who may<br>
or may not be interested in the<br>
story of his early work. Jay<br>
Jameson is likely to probably go<br>
down in Seattle history as<br>
representation of what the arts can<br>
maybe be in the Pacific Northwest.<br>
Like Dale Chiluly, or Mercury<br>
Lavender Young - may she rest in<br>
peace. Jay’s work has even been<br>
compared to Mercury’s.<br>
</p>
<p>Mini looks like she’s been slapped in the face. Grey
nervously looks to camera, and then back to Mini.<br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">GREY<br>
  (under their breath)<br>
  Mini, don’t—<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">MINI<br>
  I had no idea our mom’s name was<br>
  being dragged through the mud.<br>
  I’ll have to talk to the estate,<br>
expect a cease and desist by the<br>
end of the week.<br>
</p>
<p>Ruby looks shocked, speechless for the first time in a long
time. Mini is ready to fight. Nobody breathes.<br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">RUBY<br>
I— I’m so— She was such a— It’s an <br>
unimaginable loss to our community.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">MINI<br>
  Oh, <i>your <b>community.</b></i><br>
</p>
<p>Mini takes a step forward and Grey grabs Mini.<br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">GREY<br>
Nononononono...<br>
</p>
<p>They successfully pull Mini away, who takes a private moment
to center herself.<br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">GREY (CONT’D)<br>
  Ignore her, she’s had a long day.<br>
  Can we meet this “Jay Jameson”?<br>
</p>
<p>Ruby nods and looks around for Jay, who is staring at his Y,
his face about 2 inches from it. She snaps her fingers.<br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">RUBY<br>
Jay!<br>
</p>
<p>He is pulled from his focus and trots over. He shakes both of
their hands in earnest.<br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">JAY<br>
  Thank you so much for your support! <br>
(whispers to Ruby) <br>
Do I know them? <br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">RUBY<br>
  They’re new.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">JAY<br>
  (all smiles) <br>
I always appreciate meeting new <br>
fans and introducing them to my <br>
work. It’s still in its early <br>
stages, so be gentle, I’m very <br>
vulnerable. The art still has a <br>
lot of questions for me, and I for her. <br>

  Jay, good news, Mr. Moody said we<br>
  can soft open your LMNOP cycle<br>
  outside the counselor’s office on<br>
  Wednesday.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">JAY<br>
  Tell Mr. Moody I don’t need his<br>
  fucking pity!!! I’m a real artist.<br>
  I have a gallery opening!<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">RUBY<br>
We. We have a gallery.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">JAY<br>
  We! Gallery! I’m sorry, Ruby, that<br>
  I can’t use the proper pronouns<br>
  when my art is under duress! Maybe<br>
  25 is enough. Maybe the world<br>
  doesn’t need 32,913 words, fuck the<br>
  letter Z. Maybe I should just give<br>
  up. Maybe I should just give up.<br>

<p>Ruby and Jay take on a weird couple therapy exercises energy.
Mini and Grey exchange a look and a few whispered words while
this happens.<br></p>

  Jay. Baby. Your art is important.<br>
  You are important. You are in<br>
  demand. People want to see you.<br>
  Your ideas are innovative and<br>
  useful. Creativity flows through<br>
  each cell in your body.<br>

<p style="text-align: center;">MINI<br>
Why?<br>

<p style="text-align: center;">JAY<br>
Why what?<br>

<p style="text-align: center;">MINI<br>
  ‘What’?...???<br>
  (re-iterating)<br>
  <i>Why?</i><br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">JAY<br>
Why ‘why’?<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">MINI<br>
  Yes, <i>why ‘y’ - why the ‘Y’</i>? Is<br>
  there something underneath? Is it<br>
  deeper than this?<br>

<p style="text-align: center;">JAY<br>
  No, no, no it's just cardboard.<br>
  It’s just cardboard depth.<br>
