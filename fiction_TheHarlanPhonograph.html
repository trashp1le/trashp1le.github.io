<h5><b><i>Item History (Internal)</i></b></h5>
<p><b>SALLOW AUDIO ENGINEERING “HARLAN” PHONOGRAPH, IN WORKING ORDER
WITH ORIGINAL CRYSTAL HORN, 1914</b><br><br>
<b>Original Item Description:</b><br>
This unique and truly one-of-a-kind phonograph was commissioned by Mr. Edric Harlan in 1914
from the short-lived Sallow Audio Engineering manufacturing company. The crystal horn was
cut from a single piece of quartz of unknown origin supplied by Sallow Audio, and the
bloodwood base was salvaged from the surviving pieces of Mr. Harlan’s childhood home,
incinerated in an oil lamp accident in 1878. Runic symbols gilded in silver on the musical
cylinders reflect Mr. Harlan’s interest in the occult and spiritualistic studies, a then-popular
pastime for the social elite.<br>
After Mr. Harlan’s death in 1915, the phonograph was passed on to his daughter, who later fell
victim to the Spanish Flu in 1920. His brother, Mr. Wilfred Harlan, then came into possession of the phonograph, who sold it for five dollars at a pawn shop after The Great Crash in 1929, where
it was lost to time until recently rediscovered by Volta in 2007.<br></p>

<p><b>INCIDENT REPORT<br>
DATE: 2012/09/03<br>
TIME: 16:30<br>
LOCATION: MAIN WAREHOUSE<br>
PARTIES INVOLVED:</b> Stella Everett, David Kim, Thomas Robinson Jr., Manuel Rodriguez,
Grace Shin<br><br>
<b>INCIDENT DESCRIPTION:</b><br>
Warehouse employees (Everett, Kim, Robinson, Rodriguez, Shin) were playing the “HARLAN”
PHONOGRAPH despite repeated warnings to leave that item alone, as they had developed an
unhealthy obsession with it after its previous return in 2011. Warehouse employees had been
given adequate training and were aware of company policy not to handle any merchandise
outside of necessity.<br>
An argument over the phonograph escalated to physical violence, resulting in the deaths of Mrs.
Everett, Mr. Kim, Mr. Robinson, and Mr. Rodriguez. From reviewing security footage, it appears
the parties involved spontaneously attacked each other with tools and other nearby merchandise,
despite previously being on reportedly “good terms.”<br>
After the initial violence, Ms. Shin impaled Mr. Robinson with a forklift. Ms. Shin had had her
eye gouged out by Mr. Robinson and had been stabbed with a medieval dagger by Mrs. Everett,
who she then strangled. Ms. Shin survived her wounds.<br><br>
<b>ACTION TAKEN:</b><br>
Incident has been reported to the local authorities and camera footage turned over to detectives
for investigation. Ms. Shin was arrested on scene. “HARLAN” PHONOGRAPH has been
removed from the warehouse and locked in a secure safe in Mr. George Thornton’s private
office.
</p><br>
<p><b>INCIDENT REPORT<br>
DATE: 2012/09/25<br>
TIME: 07:00<br>
LOCATION: CEO’s private office<br>
PARTIES INVOLVED:</b> Mr. George Thornton, Mrs. Renée Murphy<br><br>
<b>INCIDENT DESCRIPTION:</b><br>
Cleaning maid found Mr. Thornton hanging from his tie early this morning, by a hook he
evidently installed in the ceiling himself. The “HARLAN” PHONOGRAPH was notably on Mr.
Thornton’s desk, playing a warped cylinder on loop. There were long scratches on the walls and
inside of the door, likely caused by Mr. Thornton as several of his nails appeared to have been
broken off. Mrs. Murphy alleges the office door was unlocked when she arrived. Furthermore,
the office keys were found in Mr. Thornton’s coat pocket.<br>
No suicide note has been found.<br><br>
<b>ACTION TAKEN:</b><br>
The local authorities and Mr. Thornton’s family have been notified. Awaiting
autopsy report. The Board will meet to discuss selecting a new CEO after Mr. Thornton’s
funeral.
</p><br>
<p><b>SALLOW AUDIO ENGINEERING “HARLAN” PHONOGRAPH</b><br>
<i>SOLD on 2013/01/19 for $15 to Susan Meadows.<br>
Addendum: do not repurchase or accept return of item under any circumstances. Any employee
who reacquires the item will be immediately terminated.</i><br>
</p><br>
<p><b>RETURN: “HARLAN” PHONOGRAPH</b><br>
<i>Returned on 2013/03/22 by the late Mrs. Susan Meadows daughter, Ms. Ann Meadows.<br>
Receptionist refused to refund or take back the phonograph, as previously directed. Ms.
Meadows then physically assaulted the receptionist before throwing the phonograph at him and
running away. Authorities were called and charges pressed against Ms. Meadows.<br>
“HARLAN” PHONOGRAPH has been marked for destruction on 2013/03/25.<br>
